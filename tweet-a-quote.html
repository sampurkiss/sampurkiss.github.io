	<p>With each of the things I build, my objective is to learn something I don't know yet.
	In this case, I wanted to figure out how Django works and get better at deploying apps.
	I've already done some work with AWS but I wanted to really learn how to build the backend
	of a website from scratch and how to share it.<br>
	I already had an existing Twitterbot that would do a bunch of things like tweet a quote
	every few hours, DM new followers, follow people back, unfollow anyone who unfollowed me
	(that's right, my bot was built to be petty).<br>
	I decided to recycle this bot and build something that's actually interactive. Using 
	Django I built an app that takes a name, searches for it on a specific website
	and webscrapes a random quote by that person. I kept the quote webscraping component from
	my previous bot <a href="https://github.com/sampurkiss/twitterbots/blob/master/get_quote_functions.py">
	(see here for the code) </a> and simply modified it to take a value from an HTML input 
	form. Then I just had to build a website with a user form, find a way to pass whatever 
	value was inputted into said form, pass it through my Python functions and return
	the results on another webpage. Then I had to modify all my scripts so I could
	actually deploy it for use by the general public. I used Heroku for deployment since
	I already have some familiarity with it and since it integrates super well with 
	Django and Github. Lastly, I used my limited HTML knowledge to make it look pretty.<br>
	Once all that was done I still had to figure out how to embed the webpage into my blog 
	in such a way that it was seamlessly integrated (and so that it works).<br>
	Overall, figuring out how to build the backend of a website was tough but I'm really 
	pleased I was able to make something that works.<br>
	I always find that when I set out to learn something, I end up learning a million other
	things I had never thought about. For example, I had never thought about dealing with CSRF, 
	xframes, switching between GitHub branches, or even the complications of taking values 
	from user inputs. What I took away from this whole project is that experience really is the best 
	teacher (and that it's cool to have friends 
	you can go to for advice - shout out to Monica and Alex).
