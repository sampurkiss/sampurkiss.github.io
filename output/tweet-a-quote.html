       <p>Enter in the name of a famous person. Once you submit, my bot will find and tweet a random quote by them. 
	   You will be able to see the tweet once it's sent.<br><br></p>

	<p>With each of the things I build, my objective is to learn something I don't know yet.
	In this case, I wanted to figure out how Django works and get better at deploying apps.
	I've already done some work with AWS but I wanted to really learn how to build the backend
	of a website from scratch and how to share it.<br>
	I already had an existing Twitterbot that would do a bunch of things like tweet a quote
	every few hours, DM new followers, follow people back, unfollow anyone who unfollowed me
	(that's right, my bot was built to be petty).<br>
	I decided to recycle this bot and build something that's actually interactive. Using 
	Django I built an app that takes a name, searches for it on a specific website
	and webscrapes a random quote by that person. I kept the quote webscraping component from
	my previous bot <a href="https://github.com/sampurkiss/twitterbots/blob/master/get_quote_functions.py">
	(see here for the code) </a> and simply modified it to take a value from an HTML input 
	form. Then I just had to build a website with a user form, find a way to pass whatever 
	value was inputted into said form, pass it through my Python functions and return
	the results on another webpage. Then I had to modify all my scripts so I could
	actually deploy it for use by the general public. I used Heroku for deployment since
	I already have some familiarity with it and since it integrates super well with 
	Django and Github. Lastly, I used my limited HTML knowledge to make it look pretty.<br>
	Once all that was done I still had to figure out how to embed the webpage into my blog 
	in such a way that it was seamlessly integrated (and so that it works).<br>
	Overall, figuring out how to build the backend of a website was tough but I'm really 
	pleased I was able to make something that works.<br>
	I always find that when I set out to learn something, I end up learning a million other
	things I had never thought about. For example, I had never thought about dealing with CSRF, 
	xframes, switching between GitHub branches, or even the complications of taking values 
	from user inputs. The lesson of this whole project is that experience really is the best 
	teacher (and that it's cool to have friends 
	you can ask for advice - shout out to Monica and Alex).
