       <p>Have you ever wondered if your favourite TV show has 
	   gotten worse over time (where are those Game of Thrones 
	   fans at?). Or maybe you're going to re-watch The Office 
	   for the billionth time and you're wondering what the best 
	   episode is (obviously it's the one where Dwight fakes a fire 
	   and Stanley has a heart attack). I'm here to tell you that you 
	   now have the ability to check any of those things. Just select 
	   a TV show from the dropdown menu and the plot will show the 
	   episode rating for the show and the show's average rating 
	   over time.<br><br></p>

		you can check out my code <a href="https://github.com/sampurkiss/movie_ratings_imdb/blob/master/dash_app.py"><font color="blue"><b>here</b></font></a>.<br>
		You can also check out the dataset I put together
